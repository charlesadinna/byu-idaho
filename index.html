          <p>Hello, My name is Adinna Charles Onyeka and I am from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy learning new things and putting them into practise. I am currently studying Software Development at BYU-Idaho through pathwaay. I also love playing snooker, swimming, reading and learning new things. I am the second child of three children my parent gave birth to. I hope to one day become a Software Developer and work for one of the great companies like Microsoft.

       <p>Lagos, nestled along Nigeria's southwestern coastline, is not only Nigeria's largest city but also the most populous in Africa, boasting a population of over 20 million people. It's a melting pot of cultures, languages, and traditions, with residents hailing from various ethnic groups across Nigeria and beyond, contributing to its vibrant cultural tapestry. Moreover, Lagos is home to Nollywood, the Nigerian film industry, which produces more movies annually than Hollywood, making it a hub for entertainment and creativity. Despite its challenges, Lagos remains a beacon of opportunity, drawing migrants from all over Nigeria and beyond seeking a better life in its bustling streets and vibrant markets.
